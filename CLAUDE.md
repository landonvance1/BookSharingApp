This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Application Overview

BookSharingApp is a **community-based book lending platform** that enables users to share physical books with others in their communities. The app facilitates the entire borrowing lifecycle from discovery to return, with built-in chat, notifications, and dispute resolution.

**Core Value Proposition:**
- Discover books available in your communities
- Request to borrow books from other members
- Track lending/borrowing status through a structured workflow
- Communicate with lenders/borrowers via real-time chat
- Manage your personal library and share availability

npm run ios           # Start with iOS simulator/device  
npm run web           # Start web version in browser
```

### Development Workflow
- The entry point is `index.ts` which registers `App.tsx` as the root component
- Use Expo Go app on physical devices for testing during development
- Web version runs in browser for quick testing of UI components

## Core Entities & Domain Model

### User
- Unique identifier (GUID)
- Profile: email, firstName, lastName, fullName
- Authentication via JWT tokens stored in SecureStore
- Can join multiple communities

### Book
- Basic book information: id, title, author, thumbnailUrl
- Unique constraint on (title, author) combination
- Thumbnails downloaded from OpenLibrary or stored locally
- Multiple users can own the same book

### UserBook (Library Entry)
- Links User to Book (ownership relationship)
- **Status enum**: Available(1), BeingShared(2), Unavailable(3)
- Users manage their personal library of books
- Only available books can be requested by others

### Share (Lending Transaction)
The core entity representing a book-sharing relationship between lender and borrower.

**Key Properties:**
- `userBookId` - The lender's book being shared
- `borrower` - User ID of the borrower
- `returnDate` - Expected return date (set by lender)
- `status` - Current workflow state

**ShareStatus Workflow:**
1. **Requested** - Borrower requests to borrow → Lender gets notification
2. **Ready** - Lender approves → Book ready for pickup
3. **PickedUp** - Borrower confirms pickup → Book in borrower's possession
4. **Returned** - Borrower returns book → Awaiting lender confirmation
5. **HomeSafe** - Lender confirms receipt → Transaction complete ✓

**Alternative Paths:**
- **Declined** - Lender rejects request (terminal state)
- **Disputed** - Either party raises issue at any stage (terminal state)

**Authorization:**
- Lender-only actions: Ready, HomeSafe, Declined, SetReturnDate
- Borrower-only actions: PickedUp, Returned
- Either party: Disputed, Archive/Unarchive

### ShareUserState (Archive State)
- Tracks per-user archive status for shares
- Allows borrower and lender to independently archive completed shares
- Only terminal states (HomeSafe, Disputed, Declined) can be archived

### Community
- Groups of users who share books with each other
- Users can join multiple communities
- Book searches are scoped to shared communities (privacy by design)
- Users limited to creating 5 communities
- Creator automatically becomes moderator
- Community deleted when last member leaves

### ChatMessage & ChatThread
- Each share has a dedicated chat thread
- Real-time messaging via SignalR WebSocket
- Message types: user messages + system messages (status changes)
- Rate limited: 30 messages per 2 minutes per user
- Paginated message history (50 per page, max 100)

### Notification
- **Types**: ShareStatusChanged, ShareDueDateChanged, ShareMessageReceived
- Separate read tracking for share vs. chat notifications
- Includes share details, message content, and actor information
- Auto-created when share status changes or messages are sent
- Persists even if share is archived

## Key Features & User Workflows

### 1. Authentication (`/src/features/auth/`)
- **Login** - Email/password authentication
- **Register** - New user account creation
- JWT tokens stored in Expo SecureStore (encrypted)
- AuthContext provides global auth state
- Refresh token support (7-day expiration)

### 2. Book Search (`Search` Tab - `/src/features/books/`)
- **Search by title or author** with 500ms debouncing
- Searches books available in your communities only
- Shows owner name and community name
- Filter by availability status
- Create share requests directly from search results
- Results limited to books you don't own

**Technical:** Uses PostgreSQL function `search_accessible_books()` for community-scoped search

### 3. Library Management (`Library` Tab - `/src/features/library/`)
**Screens:**
- **LibraryScreen** - View and manage your book collection
- **BarcodeScanner** - Scan ISBN barcode to add books
- **ExternalBookSearch** - Manual search via OpenLibrary API
- **BookConfirmation** - Confirm book details before adding

**Capabilities:**
- Add books via ISBN scan or manual search
- Update book status (Available, BeingShared, Unavailable)
- Remove books from library
- Search/filter your collection
- Books automatically set to "Available" when added

### 4. Shares Management (`Shares` Tab - `/src/features/shares/`)
**Main Screens:**
- **SharesScreen** - Two tabs:
  - "My Borrows" - Books you're borrowing from others
  - "My Lent Books" - Books you're lending to others
- **ShareDetailsScreen** - Full share information with:
  - Visual status timeline
  - Status update actions (context-aware based on role)
  - Return date management
  - Archive/unarchive functionality
  - Link to chat
- **ShareChatScreen** - Real-time chat for coordination
- **ArchivedSharesScreen** - View completed/archived shares

**Share Lifecycle:**
1. Borrower searches for book → Creates share request
2. Lender receives notification → Approves (Ready) or Declines
3. Borrower picks up book → Updates status to PickedUp
4. Borrower returns book → Updates status to Returned
5. Lender confirms → Updates to HomeSafe (complete)
6. Either party can archive once in terminal state

**Validation:**
- Cannot borrow own books
- Must share a community with book owner
- No duplicate active shares for same book by the same borrower
- Cannot skip workflow stages or move backwards
- Only available books can be requested

### 5. Real-time Chat (`/src/features/shares/`)
**Technology:** SignalR WebSocket with REST API fallback

**Features:**
- Share-specific chat rooms
- Real-time message delivery
- System messages for status changes (e.g., "Book is ready for pickup!")
- Connection status indicator
- Paginated message history
- Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff

**Rate Limiting:** 30 messages per 2 minutes per user

### 6. Notifications (`/src/features/notifications/`)
**Notification Types:**
- Share status changes (Requested, Ready, PickedUp, etc.)
- Return date set/updated
- New chat messages

**Features:**
- Unread count badge on Shares tab
- Separate mark-as-read for share vs. chat notifications
- Auto-mark read when viewing ShareDetails screen
- Polling every 30 seconds for real-time updates
- Optimistic UI updates

### 7. Communities Management (`Communities` Tab - `/src/features/communities/`)
- View communities you've joined (with member counts)
- Create new communities (limit: 5 per user)
- Leave communities
- Books are only discoverable within shared communities

### 8. Settings (`/src/features/settings/`)
- User preferences
- Logout functionality (clears tokens + React Query cache)

### Configuration Notes
- TypeScript configured with strict mode
- Expo supports iOS, Android, and web platforms
- Edge-to-edge display enabled for Android
- API base URL switches based on `__DEV__` flag
- Development API: `http://{expo-host}:5155`

## Architecture Patterns (Based on Bulletproof React)

### Project Organization
- **Feature-based structure**: Organize code within features folder for scalability
- **Unidirectional architecture**: Code flows from shared → features → app
- **Minimize cross-feature imports**: Keep features independent
- **Co-location principle**: Keep components, hooks, and utilities close to usage

### Recommended Folder Structure (For Scaling)
```
src/
├── components/        # Shared UI components
├── hooks/            # Shared custom hooks
├── lib/              # Third-party library configurations
├── types/            # Global type definitions
├── utils/            # Shared utility functions
├── assets/           # Shared assets
└── features/         # Feature modules
    └── [feature]/
        ├── api/      # Feature-specific API calls
        ├── components/ # Feature-specific components
        ├── hooks/    # Feature-specific hooks
        ├── stores/   # Feature-specific state
        ├── types/    # Feature-specific types
        └── utils/    # Feature-specific utilities
```

### State Management Strategy

**Current Implementation:** Hybrid approach combining multiple strategies

#### 1. React Query (Primary - Server State)
- **Purpose:** Server data caching and synchronization
- **Configuration:**
  - `staleTime: 30 seconds`
  - `gcTime: 5 minutes`
  - Auto-refetch on window focus & reconnect
  - 1 retry on failure
- **Usage Pattern:** Notifications feature uses React Query with:
  - 30-second polling for real-time feel
  - Optimistic updates for instant UI feedback
  - Query invalidation after mutations
  - Multiple derived hooks from same cache

#### 2. React Context (Global App State)
- **Purpose:** Authentication state management
- **Implementation:** `AuthContext` provides:
  - `user`, `isLoading`, `isAuthenticated`
  - `login()`, `register()`, `logout()` methods
  - Automatic token loading on app start
  - React Query cache clearing on logout

#### 3. Custom Hooks with useState (Feature State)
- **Purpose:** Feature-specific state management
- **Pattern:** Most features use custom hooks that encapsulate API calls + local state
- **Example:** `useShares()`, `useUserBooks()`, `useBookSearch()`
- **Benefits:**
  - Simpler API for components
  - Consistent interface across features
  - Easy to add business logic (sorting, filtering)
  - Can be migrated to React Query later if needed

#### 4. SignalR Service (Real-time State)
- **Purpose:** WebSocket connection management
- **Implementation:** Singleton service at `/src/features/shares/services/signalRService.ts`
- **Features:**
  - Event-based message broadcasting
  - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff (max 5 attempts)
  - Connection status tracking (Disconnected, Connecting, Connected, Reconnecting, Failed)

#### 5. Component State (Local UI State)
- **Use for:** Form inputs, tab selections, loading states, search queries
- **Tools:** `useState`, `useDebounceValue` hook for search inputs

**Future Considerations:**
- Migrate more features to React Query for better caching
- Add React Hook Form for form management
- Implement Zod or Yup for schema validation

### Component Patterns
- Extract distinct UI units into separate components
- Avoid nested rendering functions
- Limit component props and use composition
- Keep styling close to components
- Consider headless component libraries for flexibility

### API Layer

**Current Implementation:** Simple fetch-based REST client

**API Client** (`/src/lib/api.ts`):
- Centralized fetch wrapper with methods: `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, `delete`
- Automatic JWT token injection from SecureStore
- Base URL configuration switches based on environment
- Error handling with response parsing

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Tokens stored in Expo SecureStore (`auth_token`, `refresh_token`, `user_data`)
2. Every API call reads token from SecureStore
3. Token added to Authorization header: `Bearer {token}`
4. No automatic token refresh (manual refresh via `/auth/refresh` endpoint)

**API Organization by Feature:**
```
/src/features/{feature}/api/
├── booksApi.ts          # Book search and management
├── userBooksApi.ts      # Library operations
├── sharesApi.ts         # Share lifecycle
├── chatApi.ts           # Chat messages
├── notificationsApi.ts  # Notifications
└── communitiesApi.ts    # Community management
```

**Type Safety:**
- All API functions return typed promises
- Request/response types defined in feature `/types/` folders
- TypeScript strict mode enforced throughout

### Error Handling

**Current Implementation:** Try-catch with local error state

**Pattern:**
```typescript
try {
  await apiCall();
} catch (err) {
  const errorMessage = err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Default error';
  setError(errorMessage);
  console.error('Context:', err);
}
```

**Feedback Methods:**
- React Native Toast Messages for user notifications
- Local error state in components
- Console logging for debugging


### Testing Strategy

**Current State:** No tests implemented yet

**Recommended Approach:**
- Focus on integration and E2E tests over unit tests
- Test user experience, not implementation details
- Use Testing Library for user-centric testing
- Consider Maestro or Detox for E2E mobile testing
- Use MSW for API mocking during development
